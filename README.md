# dom-event-types

An object of DOM event types and their interfaces.

Since some event types have multiple interfaces, the interfaces are in an array.

## Usage

```
const eventInterfaces = require('dom-event-interfaces')

console.log(eventInterfaces)
//=> { "abort": ["Event","ProgressEvent","UIEvent"], ...] }
```
